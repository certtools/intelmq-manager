2.3.0 (2021-03-04)
------------------

### Backend
- The backend has been rewritten and changed from PHP to Python (PR#197 by Bernhard Herzog and Bernhard Reiter, #80)
- The backend has then been moved to a seperate repository and is now called `intelmq-api`: https://github.com/certtools/intelmq-api (PR#226)
- The name `intelmq-manager` now refers to the web frontend only

### intelmq-manager

- The `intelmq-manager` html files are now being distributed as an archive of static files. They are still built using `mako`, but
  this is done during the build of the source distribution.

#### Landing page

#### Configuration
- Remove the hover function which displayed the hovered bot's configuration (#213, PR#216 by Birger Schacht).

### Documentation
- Add a link to the failure tips (PR#215 by Edvard Rejthar).
- SQLite failure tip (PR#217 by Edvard Rejthar).

### Known issues
- Graph jumps around on "Add edge" (#148).
- wrong error message for new bots with existing ID (#152).
- Monitor page: Automatic log refresh reset log page to first one (#190).
- Load error if a bot has not optional `parameters` field in runtime configuration (#237).


2.2.1 (2020-07-30)
------------------
This IntelMQ Manager version requires IntelMQ >= 2.2.1.

### Backend
- Fix loading paths from `intelmqctl` executable (PR #205 by Einar Felipe Lanfranco).

### Documentation
- User Guide:
  - Add section on configuration paths.
  - Add section on named queues / paths.
- Readme:
  - Update screenshots (#201, PR#207 by Mladen Markovic).

### Known issues
* Graph jumps around on "Add edge" (#148).
* wrong error message for new bots with existing ID (#152).
* Monitor page: Automatic log refresh reset log page to first one (#190).

2.2.0 (2020-06-23)
------------------
This IntelMQ Manager version requires IntelMQ >= 2.2.0.

### Backend
- `config`: Get file paths from `intelmctl debug --get-paths` if possible and fall back to hard-coded paths otherwise. Thereby environment variables influencing the paths are respected (#193).

### Pages
#### About
- Show output of `intelmqctl debug`.

### Documentation
- Update release from intelmq's release documentation.
- Update Installation documentation: Fix & update dependencies and supported operating systems.

### Packaging
- Update default `positions.conf` to the default runtime/pipeline configuration of intelmq >= 2.1.1.

### Known issues
* Missing CSRF protection (#111).
* Graph jumps around on "Add edge" (#148).
* wrong error message for new bots with existing ID (#152).
* `ALLOWED_PATH=` violates CSP (#183).
* Monitor page: Automatic log refresh reset log page to first one (#190).


2.1.1 (2020-04-27)
------------------
Bernhard Herzog (Intevation) discovered that the backend incorrectly handled messages given by user-input in the "send" functionality of the Inspect-tool of the Monitor component. An attacker with access to the IntelMQ Manager could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the webserver (CVE-2020-11016).

### Backend
- Fix misspelling of the environmental variable `INTELMQ_MANGER_CONTROLLER_CMD` to `INTELMQ_MANAGER_CONTROLLER_CMD` (an 'a' was missing).
- Fix handling of POST variable `msg` of the message-sending functionality available in the Inspect-tool.

### Pages
#### Monitor
- Fix running commands with the "inspect" widget by fixing the definition of the `CONTROLLER_CMD` in the template (PR #194).

### Documentation
- Update supported operating systems in Installation documentation (i.a. PR #191).

### Known issues
* Missing CSRF protection (#111).
* Graph jumps around on "Add edge" (#148).
* wrong error message for new bots with existing ID (#152).
* `ALLOWED_PATH=` violates CSP (#183).
* Monitor page: Automatic log refresh reset log page to first one (#190).


2.1.0 (2019-10-15)
------------------

### Backend
- Fix mispelling of the environmental variable `INTELMQ_MANGER_CONTROLER_CMD` to `INTELMQ_MANGER_CONTROLLER_CMD` (you might be required to add the double 'l' to your nginx/apache server configuration)
- When displaying a command to be replicated by debugging user, the string "sudo -u {webserver user}" string is prepended so that linux user do not have to bother with sudoing himself on the commonly used user "www-data" – which often can't be sudoed to (no bash provided due to good security measures). (Used in monitor and error reporting.) 

### Frontend
- Error reporting
  - Click will enlarge the dialog that contains much more useful info, notably the very command that failed so that it can be easily reproduced.
  - Error messages are shuffled only when minimized, not when maximized. That would disturb the user trying to read the details. 
  - Invalid Syntax Error message removed. Till now, all error messages generated the string that JSON received is invalid – that wasn't needed, we knew it's invalid because it contained string message.
  - Double click does not close log window anymore since it would interfere with the user trying to select whole text by mouse.
  - Escape minimizes the reporting.
  - For common seen errors, a tip is displayed (preferable with a link to the Github manual).
 
### Pages
 
#### Configuration
 - Node group Collector now may connect to Expert and Expert can connect to Parser, however you receive a warning that it is not very common.


2.0.0 (2019-05-22)
------------------

### Backend
- Some AJAX requests are marked as to-be-cached for a little amount of time so that server load decreases when you need many tabs open.

### Pages

#### Configuration
- "Save Configuration" button reloads the bots whose destination queues changed (#175).
- Allow standard vis.js arrow and +/- navigation when network chart is focused (#176).
- Underscored letters denote shortcuts - you can now edit the network without wandering the mouse all around the screen (#176).
- Correctly load JSON parameters when editing a bot: content instead of '[object Object]' string.
- Handle not explicitly given internal queues.
- Physics / Live button are now rememberable in the positions.conf file on the server.
- When changing state or being disabled or erroneous, bot receives dashed border.
- You are allowed to create multiple edges between the same nodes - correctly displayed. If the edges should have the same paths, rename dialog appears.

#### Management
- Auto-reloading
- Clicking an action on a bot will make group panel correspond immediately
- Clicking an action on a panel will make group in the table correspond immediately

#### Monitor
- Correctly display JSON parameters: content instead of '[object Object]' string.
- Reloading logs fixed
- Reloading logs every 3 sec instead of 300 sec
- Auto-reloading logs after bot started/stopped

### Documentation
- Add SECURITY.md file.

### Known issues
* Missing CSRF protection (#111).
* Graph jumps around on "Add edge" (#148).
* wrong error message for new bots with existing ID (#152).


1.1.0 (2018-11-12)
------------------
- Add generic MIT license text to make `reuse` license checker happy (#140).

### Backend
* Using LESS for writing CSS (so CSS is now readonly)
* Fix on several places: intervals won't flood server if there is a lag, they'll wait till previous request has finished. Auto-delay/boost depending on server lag.

### Frontend
* Error reporting in a less-disturbing text box rather than an tab-wide javascript alert. Click to enlarge, double click to hide.
* Much more detailed Error reporting. What was earlier just mere 'SyntaxError: JSON.parse ...' has now included 'Failed to execute intelmqctl:~/.local/bin/intelmqctl --type json list queues' - see? That's a full command that'll help the developer so much in debugging. (Long error reports got automatically truncated to 200 characters.)
* If an error appears again and again (redis down?) it blinks instead of spamming you, updates its time and show number of times it has been thrown.
* Current tab marked in menu

### Pages

#### Configuration
* New menu item linking selected bot with the monitor (just an icon to preserve space on precious menu bar). Supports ctrl+click to new tab on the whole button area.
* New menu item to duplicate current bot, its queues included (and focus the new one); the new bot is selected and focused so that the user finds it on a big plan. It is inserted instead of the add button when a bot is selected.
* You may now see live data, each bot has its queue length in the label
* Button labels (Add bot, Add queue instead of Add node, Add edge) now makes more sense and won't shock a newcomer
* Clearly visible bot statuses; if bot is not running, its colour is dimmed.
- Manager now supports named queue paths. They are displayed along the edges and editable.
- Double click edits the bot or the queue
- Code cleanup: New modal window for performing multiple dialog actions. Intercepting visjs internals without using external Hammer library.
- Enter key submits the edit bot dialog.
- Clicking on the side-menu bot name cycles amongst bot instances in the canvas.
- Got rid of the dumb "#load" and "#new" parameter → "#new" converted into a standard URL parameter "configuration=new".
- Button to turn on/off physics
- Detection for bots not configured in runtime but in pipeline configuration (#166).
- Runtime parameters with the names 'group', 'name' or 'module' were not editable (they are read-only for the 'generic' section) (#172).
- Message counter for removed queues is correctly reset (#158).

#### Management
* Control buttons (start/stop...) now are not only part of the management tab but are common even for configuration tab and inspection panel in monitor tab. They need less configuration (thanks to $(document).on global configuration feature) and works better with less code used (single method instead of four of them). There is also a new red state 'error' for non-standard problems or invalid output from intelmqctl.
* Clicking bot name support ctrl+click to new tab
* Table doesn't redraw all the time (so that a highlighting of a browser search is preserved while clicking on a button)
* It is now possible to start/stop a group of bots easily. Additional panels are linked, so that if you eg. start all the experts, but let other bots stopped, Experts panel shows that all bots are running and Botnet panel shows that only some bots are running.

#### Monitor
* Fixed bot crawling in Monitor section (F5 will take you on the same page, not on the main monitoring page, permanent links, history browsing)
* Prefer updating the destination queues overview table over redrawing it all the time (so that you can select some text)
* Reloading a page sometimes caused a disturbing 'Error loading' alert in Firefox if an AJAX request had not yet been completed
* Fixed bug: when clicking on bot destination queue in bot detail, we won't end in an undefined bot
* Inspect panel allows you to communicate via debug functions of `intelmqctl` (see and inject messages, process single message and see output). Ctrl+Enter hits the Process button (hint included in textarea placeholder). Checkbox 'Inject message from above' marked on first text ever written to message textarea.
* The new parameters panel that displays the bot's parameters on the bot's monitor page. For parameters which are filenames, the content of these files will be shown as text if they reside in the allowed paths (set in config.php).
* When needed, Path column appears, resizing the Queues panel accordingly.
* Connected with the configuration panel → a link appears next to the bot title that takes you directly to the bot

### Known issues
